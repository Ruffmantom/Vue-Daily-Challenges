# Vue.js Daily Code Challenges

Welcome to my Vue.js Daily Challenge series! 🎯

## 👋 About

This is a personal project where I work through daily frontend challenges using **Vue.js (Options API)**. My goal is to sharpen my skills by building real-world UI components, improve my understanding of reactive state, and get more comfortable writing clean, modular code in Vue.

While I've already learned the Composition API, my current work project is built using the **Options API**, so this challenge series is intentionally focused on that.

## 💡 Challenge Format

Each challenge includes:
- A brief **scenario** (like building a tab system or a form wizard)
- A set of **goals or requirements**
- A single or multi-file Vue component structure
- Emphasis on clean syntax, Vue fundamentals, and reusability

I try to go beyond just getting it to "work" — I focus on:
- Proper component structure
- Event handling and prop flow
- Readability and maintainability

## 📁 Folder Structure (Sample)

```
vue-daily-challenges/
| | components/
| ├── 01-challengeName/
│    ├── Component.vue
│    ├── ComponentTwo.vue
│    └── README.md
| ├── 02-challenge...
|    └── ...
```

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- Stay sharp on **Vue fundamentals**
- Build a solid **Options API muscle memory**
- Explore patterns I can apply directly to my work projects
- Create a small, growing repo of **copy-pasteable solutions**

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

As I go, I may add:
- Vue router & Vuex integrations
- Unit testing with Vue Test Utils
- Composition API versions of some components (for contrast)
- Design improvements using Tailwind or similar
